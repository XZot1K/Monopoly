## Description:

    * The game is designed to be very user-friendly and flow controlled. As the player clicks a button or performs an operation it is
      pretty clear of what can and cannot be done in that particular moment.

## Tweaked Rules:

    * Rather than implement a full on trade system, the player can sell/buy "Get Out of Jail Free" cards from other players at random.

    * Upon achieving bankruptcy, the player's owned properties will be reset as if they were never purchased rather than all going to
      whom caused them to go bankrupt.

## Partners:

    * Jeremiah handled all hand-drawn imagery and GUI-related elements alongside some minor areas of logic such as piece positioning and movement.

    * Dominick handled all complex logic from chance & community chest cards to game flow.

## Sources:

    * All image-related resources are traced or free-hand drawn custom styled versions of the official Monopoly game board.

    * Dice-Sprite was based on the dice found at https://www.freeiconspng.com/img/27661
